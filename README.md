Problem Statement:
Consider an ideal CMOS inverter having load capacitance of 50 fF with the following specifications: Wn= 5um, Ln(p)= 1um, GAMMAn(p)=0.4(0.57) V^(1/2), LAMBDAn(p)=0.04(0.05) V^(-1), PHIn(p)=0.7(0.8) V, Kn(p)=110(44) uA/V^(2), Vto,n(p)=+(-) 0.7V, and VDD=5V. The circuit is driven by a 2.5GHz ideal clock having 50% duty cycle.
